<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center">
   This project was developed during the Next Level Week, an intensive week of study, networking, friendship, group work, accompanied by a fantastic project developed by Rocketseat from April 19th to April 25th.<br>
   The purpose of this application is to be a Quiz for programmers to enhance their programming knowledge through the exercises proposed by the application, offering interactive questions and answers.<br>
   It's a basic project so far, but it opens up many doors for ideas, features, partnerships, and a lot of learning that I will take into my professional life. Another successful NLW week completed with a strong presence in the community, helping others and answering their questions. It was amazing!<br>

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings Along the Way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   This project was challenging for me and for the entire community. A simple application, but well-structured and organized.
   I encountered various challenges along the way, but I already see that I'm much more mature about the mistakes I used to make, feeling more confident and secure than ever about what I do. This NLW week helped me a lot in analyzing and seeing the paths I can and want to follow.<br> 
   The community on the event's Discord was fantastic, with many people with good intentions and wanting to evolve together...<br>
